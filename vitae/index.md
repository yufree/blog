## Computer Skills

- <s>I currently use Windows 8 but I am also working under Ubuntu for a long time, both of which are excellent operation system</s> Now I use Ubuntu again;

- I use Tex(lyx) to layout my papers but sometimes I have to use Word and I am skilled at both of them;

- Both of Vim and Emacs are good text editors, but in fact I use <s>notebook or </s>gedit for most of the time;

- Most of my data analysis is done under RStudio wiht Knitr and I think repeatability studies are important for every scientist and I know how to use Excle, origin, SPSS, Matlab... but I just prefer R;

- Beamer is simple and Powerpoint is beautiful but recently I found html5 could be used to give a presentation well;

- <s>I use Endnote to manage my literatures and comment each of them, then I will use evernote to collect some novol ideas and bibtex for a paper</s>I use Zotero and 4share as webdev for attachment;

- I learned C when I was a freshman then I also learned S, python and Matlab for simple programming in my research but I think shell is more powerful;

- I could read stuctured codes and I just guess the usages of some codes when I need to use them but for most of the time, it works;

- I am also skilled to get aross the great firewall so never worried about it.

_I love open source software!_
