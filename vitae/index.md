# Computer Skills

- I use Tex(lyx) to layout my papers but sometimes I have to use Word and I am skilled at both of them;

- Most of my data analysis is done under RStudio wiht Knitr and I think repeatability studies are important for every scientist and I know how to use Excle, origin, SPSS, Octave... but I just prefer R;

- Beamer is simple and Powerpoint is beautiful but recently I found html5 could be used to show a bettter presentation;

- I use Zotero to manage my literatures and use 4share as webdev for attachment;

- I learned C when I was a freshman then I also learned S, python and Matlab for simple programming in my research but I think shell is more powerful;

- I could read stuctured codes and guess the usages of some functions by their names. For most of the time, it works;

- I tried to learn PS many times and finally chose ImageJ;

- I am also skilled to get aross the great firewall so never worried about it.

_I love open source software!_
