Hi, My name is YU Miao and I am a Ph.D. candidate in Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences(RCEES), Chinese Academy of Sciences. 

My major is Evironmental Science so I am a dabbler person in many science subjects. I have board interests such as cook, photograph, programming... but they are just hobbies, not special talents. So you know I am a dabbler in life, too. 

I am lazy, so I just modified [Xie's pages](http://yihui.name) to show this blog(in fact, I just got the parts which I could figure out the meanings and thanks a lot, Xie). But I am easy-going and willing to learn something new, so this blog will be focused on something ingteresting in my life in English. 

For English is not my mothor tongue, you have to bear my tongue to read my articles.

No papers, No girlfriend, No money. 

Don't panic!
