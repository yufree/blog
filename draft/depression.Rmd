# What is Depression?

## Diagnostic Criteria of Major Depressive Episode

### At least one of the following three abnormal moods significantly interfered with the person's life:

- Abnormal depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, for at least two weeks (dysphoria)

- Abnormal loss of all interest and pleasure most of the day, nearly every day, for at least two weeks (anhedonia)

- If 18 or younger, abnormal irritable mood most of the day, nearly every day, for at least two weeks

### At least five of the following symptoms have been present during the same two week depressed period

- Depressed mood (criterion A, above)
- Loss of all interest and pleasure (criterion B, above)
- Appetite or weight disturbance
- Sleep disturbance
- Agitation or slowing
- Fatigue or loss of energy
- Abnormal inappropriate guilt
- Poor concentration
- Thoughts of death or suicide

- Inheritance
- Stress/Loss

# Prevalence and Incidence of Major Depressive Episode

## Prevalence: the proportion in the population with the illness, e.g., a percentage (burden)

- Define and count the population denominator
- Count cases for the numerator from that defined population
 
## Incidence: the rate at which new cases form in the population, e.g.rate per time (force of morbidity)

- Define the population
- Define the cohort (risk set) who have never had the disorder
- Define the time period for follow-up
- Count the number of person years for the denominator
- Count the number of new cases for the numerator

## variety

- gender: female early
- age: after 50
- lifetime: raise then decrease
- culture: east low, west high

# The Natural History of Major Depressive Disorder

- Prodrome is the period after the disease has begun, before it is diagnosed
  - Dysphoria and suicide have a long prodrome
- Onset is the beginning of the first episode
  - Episodes last several months
- Remission is the end of the symptoms in an episode
- Recovery occurs when a year has passed without another episode
- Recurrence is the start of a later episode after recovery
  - About 50% of all lifetime cases have only one episode
  - About 15% of all lifetime cases are unremitting
  - About 35% of all lifetime cases have a relapsing and remitting course
- Gender Is Associated With Prevalence of Major Depressive Disorder, But Not With Bipolar Disorder
- Gender Affects Incidence But Not Recurrence and Duration

# Estimating the Burden of Major Depressive Disorder and Medical Conditions

- Estimating the Burden of Diseaseâ€“Disability Weights
  - Disability weight of 0.0 = healthy person
  - Disability weight of 1.0 = death
  - Disability weight of 0.5 = disability weight indicating the prevention program would have to extend life for two years
- Depression for estimation of disability weight: about 0.35 and top3 around the world
