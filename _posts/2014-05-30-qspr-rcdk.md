title: Using rcdk package for QSPR
---
========================================================

`R` is a handy tool for modeling, so there must be some packages for  Quantitative structureâ€“activity relationship(QSPR) in Chemistry. Recently I wanted to summarize some papers for a presentation, then I found rcdk package, which is a useful tool for QSPR. However, little posts about this topic for beginner. As an absolutely beginner, I make this post as a note for the whole process and add comments for someone else to reproduce a QSPR model by their own.

First,you need the following knowledge:

- Chemistry Development Kit(CDK) is powerful, we will use their function to read in the molecular and calculate some descriptor via `rcdk` package and no need to install CDK and their function has been included in the package

- Just `install.packages(c('rJava','rcdk'))` is enough for a R user

- Copy the smiles files or the sdf files to your work directory or just use a demo data `bpdata`

- Then we begin



```r

library(rcdk)

data(bpdata)

# the first column is the SMILES vector of the molecular structures so we
# use parse.smiles to read it

mols <- parse.smiles(bpdata[, 1])

# so rcdk will convert the smiles into a java object this object could be
# used to get the milecular descriptor also you need to know the class of
# mols is a list


# rcdk has five ctegories of descriptor we think the topological descriptor
# may relate to the Boiling Point

desc.names <- get.desc.names("topological")

# then we get the names of those topological descriptors
```

Up to now, we know the structures and the descriptors' name. Then we will get the descriptors.


```r

# for the list we need to use lapply or sapply to apply the descriptors
# caculator function with the descriptors' name in the desc.names

data <- lapply(mols, eval.desc, desc.names)

# this is also a list so we need to unlist and make a dataframe for QSPR
# model also we need to give the column a name

df <- data.frame(matrix(unlist(data), nrow = 277, byrow = T))
colnames(df) <- colnames(data[[1]])

# we need to remove some desciptors unchanged

df2 <- df[, which(!apply(df, 2, sd) == 0)]
```


OK, here we get a data frame contained the descriptors we needed. Then we will use those $$X$$ to make a $$f(X) = Y$$, which is a QSPR model.


```r

# define the response

Y <- bpdata[, 2]

# get a train set and a test set

train <- sample(1:277, 200)
traindataX <- df2[train, ]
traindataY <- Y[train]

testdataX <- df2[-train, ]
testdataY <- Y[-train]

# build a regression model with the leaps packages

library("leaps")

# define a function to predict the test data

predict.regsubsets = function(object, newdata, id, ...) {
    form = as.formula(~.)
    mat = model.matrix(form, newdata)
    coefi = coef(object, id)
    xvars = names(coefi)
    mat[, xvars] %*% coefi
}

# 5-fold cross-validation

k = 5
set.seed(1)
folds = sample(1:k, nrow(traindataX), replace = TRUE)
cv.errors = matrix(NA, k, 50, dimnames = list(NULL, paste(1:50)))
for (j in 1:k) {
    best.fit = regsubsets(y = traindataY[folds != j], x = traindataX[folds != 
        j, ], nvmax = 50, really.big = T, method = "forward")
    for (i in 1:50) {
        pred = predict.regsubsets(best.fit, traindataX[folds == j, ], id = i)
        cv.errors[j, i] = mean((traindataY[folds == j] - pred)^2)
    }
}
```

```r

mean.cv.errors = apply(cv.errors, 2, mean)

which.min(mean.cv.errors)
```

``` 
## 38
```

```r

reg.fwd = regsubsets(x = traindataX, y = traindataY, nvmax = 44, really.big = T, 
    method = "forward")
```

```r

# we got a model with many variables now we could see the results on the
# test dataset

val.errors <- rep(NA, 50)
for (i in 1:50) {
    pred = predict.regsubsets(reg.fwd, testdataX, id = i)
    val.errors[i] = mean((testdataY - pred)^2)
}
```

```r

plot(sqrt(val.errors), xlab = "Number of Variables", ylab = "Root MSE", pch = 19, 
    type = "b")
```

![plot of chunk fwd](../figure/fwd.png) 

```r

which.min(val.errors)
```

```
## [1] 41
```

```r

# so I think 15 variables is enough for prediction the selected QSPR model
# coef is shown below

coef(reg.fwd, 15)
```

```
## (Intercept)    khs.dCH2     khs.sOH      khs.dO    HybRatio        VP.2 
##     310.981     -69.776      70.007      38.068     -61.738      58.648 
##       SPC.4       SPC.6        SC.4        VC.3       ATSm5       ATSc2 
##      -4.957      -3.223     -75.819     -42.528       1.890      35.852 
##       ATSc4     khs.aaS      khs.sI       C4SP3 
##      31.831       0.000      -8.693      10.937
```


From the results I find the  topological descriptors might be not good for the prediction for that no clear overfit were found in train and test dataset. 

OK, this is the whole process for using rcdk package for QSPR. Just modify the input, you will get what you want.
